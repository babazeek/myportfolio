    <h2>MY PORTFOLIO</h2>
    <p><em>A glimpse of some of the projects I've been working on.</em></p>
    <h3> a)Data cleaning in SQL to facilitate the  creation of a dashboard on Ms.Excel to track the pizza sales metrics and assist in decision making. .</h3>
    <img src="Screenshot (17).png" alt="sample dashboard">
    <p>I Imported data in MS SQL Server Data Base, created a Data Base, wrote  the queries then exported the data to Excel. The highlights were requirement gathering, data cleaning, processing, analysis and the dashboard creation in Excel.</p>

    <h3> b)Data cleaning in SQL to facilitate the  creation of a dashboard on Ms. Power BI.</h3>
    <p>In this project, I began by importing and exploring the Blinkit grocery dataset to understand its structure and check for inconsistencies. I then cleaned the data by standardizing entries in the ‚ÄòItem_Fat_Content‚Äô column to ensure uniformity for accurate grouping and analysis. Once the data was clean, I computed key performance metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items, and average ratings. I further broke down the data by categories like fat content, item type, outlet size, location, and establishment year to uncover deeper insights. The final result was a well-structured dataset ready for visualization in Power BI, enabling the creation of dashboards that display business-critical metrics.</p>
